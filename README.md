## Red Knot Abundance on Fire Island

This is a project examining if there are seasonal patterns within the rufa subspecies of red knot, and if there is preference for red knots using habitat, on Fire Island (bayside habitat vs. oceanside habitat). I would also like to use resight data to describe mean stopover time at Fire Island. Data was collected from Virginia Tech Shorebird lab 2013-2016 by conducting transect surveys and counting different observed shorebird species. Resight data was collected by Virginia Tech Shorebird lab from 2013-2018.

####WEEK 1####
Basic R commands, library calls, functions, data import. Read csv file in and manipulated some data.
Using file RK Shorebird Surveys. 


###WEEK 2###
Using file RK Shorebird Surveys. 
Mutate/aggregate/summarize, calculated redknot counts/subsite. Trying to arrange by date and plot by year to look at seasonal peaks and determine high peak count per year.

###WEEK 3###
Using file "RK_ShorebirdSurveys"", code=Homework3.R
Plotted 2 graphs showing 1) the counts of REKN throughout each year by Subsite, and 2) the counts of REKN throughout each year by habitat.
I had some help from my lab to parse out problems with Date columns...we converted Date to Julian Date to work around the whole continuous problem...I think I would like to change line graphs for histograms I think? If that would portray the data better...
